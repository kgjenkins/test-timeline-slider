TEST timeline slider for short narratives

For discussion:
- Timeline text: is it better to show years, or descriptive titles?
- Show all the markers for a given person?
- Draw a line between markers up to current point in the timeline slider?
- Skip the timeline altogether, and just list the entries on the left, under the name of the person?
- Show the markers for everyone in a given year?  (but this would require more complete timeline entries, since not every year is recorded for a person)
- Better handling of the zoom level.  Zoomed out works better for longer distances, but for short moves, the map merely wiggles, and it would be helpful to zoom in.  Two options: 1. Try to calculate a zoom level from the difference between points, or 2. Record the zoom level in the point attributes (probably too tedious)
- Add keyboard controls (left- and right-arrow to move between timeline entries, page-up and -down to move between people?)
